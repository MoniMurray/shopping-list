## Manual Testing<a name="manual_testing"></a>

### Manual testing tests as follows:

- Each User Story
- Full Feature functionality
- Browser Compatibility 
- Report on Bugs resolved/unresolved


### Testing User Stories

This is where I manually tested each of the User Stories I created during Agile planning, and which are listed in [AGILE.md](AGILE.md), against my application. I have used the User Stories table for the following Test Case list, the Acceptance Criteria Tasks are repurposed to become the Tests.

Tutor Support explained anything in the static/ folder will be uploaded to cloudinary, including the README wireframes and screenshots I was storing there. This needlessly used up storage space on cloudinary. If a README image files had spaces in the name it would cause a cloudinary error. The fix was to delete all the files off cloudinary, move the unnecessary files from static/ into a new folder named 'readme_media/' and redeploy. In short, my static/ folder should only include the files that will appear on on my application. README images should go elsewhere. |

## Automated Testing<a name="automated_testing"></a>

Automated Testing includes all testing that is carried out by a program -  W3C HTML validation and CSS Validation, PEP8 Python Compliance, Lighthouse responsiveness.

### W3C Validator

The most popular HTML validator is W3C. 

[W3C URL Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmym-shopping-list.herokuapp.com%2F)

![W3C URL Validato](static/images/screenshots/w3validator_result.png)


### CSS Validation

CSS Validation can only be done by copying and pasting the CSS file contents into the direct input. 

[W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)

![W3C CSS Validation](readme_media/screenshots/testing/w3c_css_validation.png)

### Python Code testing

[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)

All clear, no errors found.

The following files were tested:

- views.py
- admin.py
- forms.py
- models.py
- test_views.py
- test_models.py

### Javascript Testing

base.html contains Javascript which handles the alert messages for the site, and which has a timeout set to 3 seconds, after which the message fades from the user's screen. 

This was manually tested and works as expected. [JShint](https://jshint.com/) was also used to test this Javascript with no errors reported.

### Lighthouse

Lighthouse Testing is part of the Chrome Developer Tools. For more information on how to use this tool, please visit chrome Lighthouse.
