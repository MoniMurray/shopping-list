AUTOMATED TESTING<a name="automated_testing"></a>

Automated Testing includes all testing that is carried out by a program -  W3C HTML validation and CSS Validation, PEP8 Python Compliance, Lighthouse responsiveness.

 W3C Validator

The most popular HTML validator is W3C. 

[W3C URL Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fmym-shopping-list.herokuapp.com%2F)

![W3C URL Validato](static/images/screenshots/w3validator_result.png)


CSS Validation

CSS Validation can only be done by copying and pasting the CSS file contents into the direct input. 

[W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)

![W3C CSS Validation](readme_media/screenshots/testing/w3c_css_validation.png)

Python Code testing

[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)

All clear, no errors found.

The following files were tested:

- views.py
- admin.py
- forms.py
- models.py
- test_views.py
- test_models.py


Lighthouse

Lighthouse Testing is part of the Chrome Developer Tools. For more information on how to use this tool, please visit chrome Lighthouse.

You will need to run the Lighthouse testing on each individual page of your site, for desktop as a minimum. If you have time it would be great to also add in the mobile testing.

Coverage Tool

The Coverage testing tool evaluates your whole project and reports on what percentage of the project has been tested with automated testing.  This tool needs to be installed, in the CLI type:  

pip3 install coverage

To run the Coverage tool, in the CLI type:

coverage run --source=list manage.py test

Coverage tells you what percentage of the application's code has been tested - it does not tell you what percentage of your code passed the tests. Coverage generates a report in HTML, in the CLI type:

coverage report

To generate an interactive HTML report use the following command in the CLI:

coverage html

This will create a new folder called 'htmlcov' in which there is an index.html file.  As with all html files, in order to view the file, in the CLI type:

python3 -m http.server

Open the browser to inspect files which will indicate where in the application tests still need to be performed.

Write any remaining tests Coverage reports has gone untested.

BUGS
Known Bugs
List (or put in a table) all known bugs on your site here as soon as you find them. This will prevent you from forgetting any at the end. Some (if not all) of these bugs will hopefully make their way over to the next section, solved bugs, as you progress through your project.

Solved Bugs
👩🏻‍💻View an example of a completed bugs section here

This is where all solved bugs go once squashed. List what the bug was, and how you managed to fix it. You can also include images/videos here if you wanted.


MANUAL TESTING<a name="manual_testing"></a>

Manual testing tests as follows:

- Each Feature
- Each User Story
- Visual Responsiveness
- Browser Compatibility Testing
- Report on Bugs resolves/unresolved


Testing User Stories

This is where I tested the User Stories I created and listed in [AGILE.md](AGILE.md) against my application. I have used the User Stories table for this Test Case list, the Acceptance Criteria Tasks are repurposed to become the Tests.

Tutor Support explained anything in the static/ folder will be uploaded to cloudinary, including the README wireframes and screenshots I was storing there. This needlessly used up storage space on cloudinary. If a README image files had spaces in the name it would cause a cloudinary error. The fix was to delete all the files off cloudinary, move the unnecessary files from static/ into a new folder named 'readme_media/' and redeploy. In short, my static/ folder should only include the files that will appear on on my application. README images should go elsewhere. |
